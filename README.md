# XmlTools

XmlTool is a tool to allow for the easier editing of Bannerlord's XML documents via the use of csv files. It will read files from Data/[object_type]/, and output them in Output/[object_type]/

This is still a work in progress project, however an end goal is for all of Bannerlord's xml files to be supported by this program to greatly east the development of mods.
